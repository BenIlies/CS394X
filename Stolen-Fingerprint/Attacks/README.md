# Attack on Fingerprint Theft

To reproduce the attack on fingerprint theft, follow these steps:

1. Fingerprint Acquisition:
   - Use ink and capture a clear picture of the fingerprint.

2. Image Manipulation:
   - Flip the fingerprint image horizontally.

3. Cropping and Monochrome Translation:
   - Crop the fingerprint image to isolate the fingerprint region of interest.
   - Convert the image to a monochrome representation (black or white) depending on a threshold value. Adjust the threshold to achieve the desired result.

4. Color Translation:
   - Visit [Online JPG Tools](https://onlinejpgtools.com/create-binary-jpg).
   - Upload the black and white fingerprint image.
   - Follow the instructions to translate the image into grayscale.

5. Translation to STL Format:
   - Visit [Image to STL](https://imagetostl.com/).
   - Upload the grayscale fingerprint image.
   - Follow the instructions to convert the image to the STL format suitable for 3D printing.

6. Build for 3D Printer:
   - Prepare the HALOT-ONE PLUS Resin 3D Printer or a compatible 3D printer for printing.
   - Load the generated STL file onto the printer.
   - Initiate the printing process and ensure the fingerprint model is accurately reproduced.
