# Windows Firewalling

One way to mitigate these attacks is to restrict every application from communicating to the server (IP : 10.10.1.251 and Port: 9999) except allowing only a trusted application to the server. The trusted application (.exe) can be generated by (TODO: example.py). To configure firewall follow these steps

1. Go to windows firewall. Make sure to turn on windows firewall. (attack image)
2. Now to Advance Setting and make sure following rule under Domain, Public and Private.
   1. Outbound connection that do not match are blocked.
   2. Inbound connection that do not match are blocked.

3. At this point you won't be able to connect to the server unless you add a rule
4. Now click on outbound rules > Actions > New rule
5. In the prompt, select **Program** > Next
6. Now add the path to the app you want to provide access to the server. Make sure it's in **Program Files** > Next.
7. In the **Action** > **Allow the Connection** > Next
8. In Profile select all three (Domain, Public and Private)
9. Finally provide a name to the rule and finish
10. Now open rule properties that you just created and select **Scope** > Add server's IP address(i.e 10.10.1.251)
11. Now select **Protocols and Ports** > Select **TCP** as Protocol > Add **9999** to the **Port**
12. Apply and close. Make sure the rule is enabled.
